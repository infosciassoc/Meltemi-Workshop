# ISA AI Workshop #1 - Building with Meltemi: The First Open LLM for Greek üåÄ

Welcome to the **first-ever workshop organized by ISA**! The theme of this workshop is [**Meltemi**](https://www.ilsp.gr/news/meltemi/), the first open large language model for Greek, and how it can be used in conjunction with **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Technology**.  

We had the honor of hosting the **Meltemi Team** from the [**Institute for Language and Speech Processing (ILSP)**](https://www.ilsp.gr/en/home-2/), including:  

- [**Vassilis Katsouros**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vassilis-katsouros-bb07751b0/), Director of Research and Director of ILSP 
- [**Sokratis Sofianopoulos**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sokratis-sofianopoulos-ba624b6/), Collaborating Researcher
- [**Giorgos Paraskeuopoulos**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/geopar/), Collaborating Researcher 
- [**Prokopis Prokopidis**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/prokopis-prokopidis-6891a6150/), Collaborating Researcher  
- [**Dimitris Roussis**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dimitrios-roussis/), Collaborating Researcher
- [**Leon Voukoutis**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leon-voukoutis-867761301/), Collaborating Researcher

This repository serves as a summary and resource hub for the day‚Äôs activities, including key presentations and hands-on coding sessions.

## üìÖ Workshop Agenda

### **11:15 ‚Äì Panel: From Wind to Words - The Journey of Meltemi**
A captivating discussion about **Meltemi**, exploring its origins, how the idea took shape and became a reality, technical details of its development, and hints about the next steps. This engaging panel was moderated by [**Konstantinos Eleftheriou**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/konstantinos-eleutheriou/), Head of Software at ISA, with the entire **Meltemi Team** as panelists.

### **12:30 ‚Äì Hugging Face Intro**
An introductory tutorial on **Hugging Face**, hosted by [**Ippokratis Pantelidis**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ippokratis-pantelidis/) and [**Nikos Mitsakis**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikos-mitsakis/), Heads of AI at ISA, answering foundational questions such as "What is Hugging Face?" and "How and why can we use it?". This session covered the Hugging Face user interface, explained how to leverage its resources in code, and demonstrated using **Meltemi** directly through Hugging Face to tackle various tasks. 

The complete Jupyter Notebook from this session can be found [here](https://github.com/infosciassoc/Meltemi-Workshop/blob/main/Hugging%20Face%20Intro/Hugging_Face_Intro.ipynb).

### **14:00 ‚Äì Hands-on Session on RAG: Techniques Leveraging Meltemi**
This session, presented by **Giorgos Paraskeuopoulos** covered both theoretical and practical aspects of **RAG**, including its components, the pipeline, and its usefulness. Giorgos explained how to leverage **Meltemi** with RAG technology to answer questions with up-to-date, precise answers, while minimizing hallucinations in the generation process. The session seamlessly transitioned from theory to practice, with code examples showing how to implement RAG with **Meltemi**.

The resources (Slides and Jupyter Notebook) for the session can be found [here](https://github.com/infosciassoc/Meltemi-Workshop/tree/main/RAG%20Session).

### **15:30 ‚Äì Hands-On Development**
At the end of the workshop, participants had the chance to apply everything they had learned, using **Meltemi** with **RAG** to build their own applications. This hands-on session allowed attendees to experiment with the tools and techniques discussed earlier and develop real-world AI solutions.  

**The project description** can be found [here](https://github.com/infosciassoc/Meltemi-Workshop/blob/main/Hands-On%20Development/Project_Description.pdf).  
The best 3 projects from this phase are soon to be announced!
